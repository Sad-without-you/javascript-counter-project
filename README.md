# JavaScript Counter Project

This is a simple JavaScript project that implements a basic counter. The counter allows users to increase, decrease, or reset the count value. The color of the count changes dynamically based on whether the value is positive, negative, or zero.

## Features

- **Dynamic Count Display**: The count value updates in real-time as you interact with the buttons.
- **Color-Coded Count**: 
  - Green for positive numbers.
  - Red for negative numbers.
  - Black for zero.
- **Responsive Design**: The buttons and display are styled to look good on different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Buttons have smooth hover and active state animations.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing the counter logic and handling button interactions.
